# RHash

RHash  (Recursive  Hasher)   is  a  console  utility  for   calculation  and
verification of magnet links and various hash sums, including CRC32, CRC32C,
MD4, MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, SHA3, AICH, ED2K, DC++ TTH, BitTorrent BTIH,
Tiger, GOST R 34.11-94, GOST R 34.11-2012, RIPEMD-160, HAS-160, EDON-R,  and
Whirlpool.

Hash sums are used to  ensure and verify integrity  of large volumes of data
for a long-term storing or transferring.

### Program features:
 * Ability to process directories recursively.
 * Output in a predefined (SFV, BSD-like) or a user-defined format.
 * Calculation of Magnet links.
 * Updating hash files (adding hash sums of files missing in the hash file).
 * Calculates several hash sums in one pass.
 * Portability: the program works the same on Linux, Unix, macOS or Windows.

## Installation
```shell
./configure && make install
```
For more complicated cases of installation see the [INSTALL.md] file.
