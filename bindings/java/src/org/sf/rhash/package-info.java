/**
 * Java bindings for librhash.
 * Librhash is a library for computing and verifying hash sums.
 * List of all supported hash functions can be found in
 * {@link org.sf.rhash.HashType} class description.
 * <p>
 * In its simplest usage to calculate a hash for message or file
 * you just need to use one of <code>RHash.computeHash()</code>
 * methods:
 * <pre>
 *     RHash.computeHash("Hello, world!");
 *     RHash.computeHash(new byte[] { 0, 1, 2, 3});
 *     RHash.computeHash(new File("SomeFile.txt"));</pre>
 * These methods return value of type <code>Hash</code> which is
 * a message digest. To convert <code>Hash</code> in human readable
 * format you might use one of methods
 * {@link org.sf.rhash.Hash#hex() hex()},
 * {@link org.sf.rhash.Hash#base32() base32()},
 * {@link org.sf.rhash.Hash#base64() base64()} or
 * {@link org.sf.rhash.Hash#raw() raw()}.
 * </p><p>
 * Next, <code>RHash</code> allows you to do incremental hashing,
 * processing data given in portions like it was one big byte sequence.
 * To do this you first need to create <code>RHash</code> instance
 * with a set of needed hash algorithms and then to fill it using
 * <code>update()</code>:
 * <pre>
 *     RHash hasher = new RHash(HashType.MD5);
 *     hasher.update("Foo").update(new File("Bar.zip")).finish();
 *     Hash result = hasher.getDigest();</pre>
 * Method <code>finish()</code> should be called before obtaining
 * digest to end all calculations and generate result.
 * </p><p>
 * You can setup <code>RHash</code> to calculate several digests
 * at once, passing corresponding <code>HashType</code>s in
 * constructor. Specifically, you can calculate all of them creating
 * <code>RHash</code> like
 * <pre>
 *     new Rhash(EnumSet.allOf(HashType.class));</pre>
 * In this case to obtain digest for particular hash type use
 * {@link org.sf.rhash.RHash#getDigest(HashType) }
 * method.
 * </p>
